# Remix Dark Mode

**Note**: This repo is not being actively maintained. If you would like to see an up-to-date implementation, or suggest a change, I recommend the official Remix example repo, which was originally built based on this implementation. See https://github.com/remix-run/examples/tree/main/dark-mode.

This is a MVP example of how to implement dark mode in Remix. A demo of the final product can be seen [here](https://remix-dark-mode.vercel.app/).

## Deployment

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.
